This project was created to take data from a user using the terminal.
The data taken from the user is: name of a song, name of a band, name of a movie.
This information is then passed into the appropriate api.

The song data is enterted into the Spotify Api
The band data is enterted into the Bands in Town Api
The movie data is entered into the OMDB Api.

The date is then proccesed by each api and displayed in the terminal window

This is a great program for accessing popular songs,movies & band information
